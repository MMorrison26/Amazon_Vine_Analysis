# Amazon Shoes Vine Analysis

## *Overview*
We've been tasked to research the effect of paid Amazon Vine members who publish reviews as compared to any reviews written by the average non-paid consumer. By digging into the data, we can determine whether there is a basis towards favorable reviews from Vine Members who are paid to receive products and then write a review about them.

## *Results*
There were extremely few Vine reviews as compared to non-Vine reviews. 
* When filtered to rows that had at least 20 votes, there were only 22 reviews out of 27,884 reviews that were by paid Vine members. That's a mere 8% of the overall total votes. <br/>

* Only 13 Vine reviews were 5 stars whereas 14,581 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars. 
* Overall there is a slightly larger *percentage* of 5 star ratings for Vine reviews (59%), but it's not a ton more (compared to 52% of non-Vine reviews). With such a small dataset of 22 Vine reviews, it's hard to compare to the very large and reliable dataset of non-Vine reviews.

## *Summary*
It's arguable there's a small positivity bias for Vine reviewers, but it might be helpful to analyze some of the other available Amazon datasets to see if there are more Vine reviews present. If we had more data, it would give more clout to the percentage of Vine reviews that were a perfect 5 stars. In addition, it might be helpful to calculate the average rating overall between the 2 datasets to see how that compares. It may be that paid reviewers feel ever more obligated to give very honest (and potentially poor) reviews when they're getting paid. It would be interesting to see the number of 2 and 3 star reviews as compared to the non-paid reviews.
