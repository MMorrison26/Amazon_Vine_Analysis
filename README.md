# Amazon Shoes Vine Analysis

## *Overview*
We've been tasked to research the effect of paid Amazon Vine members who publish reviews as compared to any reviews written by the average non-paid consumer. By digging into the data, we can determine whether there is a basis towards favorable reviews from Vine Members who are paid to receive products and then write a review about them.

## *Results*
There were extremely few Vine reviews as compared to non-Vine reviews. 
* When filtered to rows that had at least 20 votes, there were only 22 reviews out of 27,884 reviews that were by paid Vine members. That's a mere 8% of the overall total votes. <br/>

* Only 13 Vine reviews were 5 stars whereas 14,581 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars. 
* Overall there is a slightly larger *percentage* of 5 star ratings for Vine reviews (59%), but it's not a ton more (compared to 52% of non-Vine reviews). With such a small dataset of 22 Vine reviews, it's hard to compare to the very large and reliable dataset of non-Vine reviews.
